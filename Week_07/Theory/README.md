#### About

Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a Micro Services.
It is easy to create a stand-alone and production ready spring application.



The Spring Boot Maven plugin provides many convenient features:

1) It collects all the jars on the classpath and builds a single, runnable jar, which makes it more convenient to execute and transport your service.
2) searches for the public static void main() method to flag as a runnable class.
3) It provides a built-in dependency resolver that sets the version number to match Spring Boot dependencies. 
You can override any version you wish, but it will default to Bootâ€™s chosen set of versions.
